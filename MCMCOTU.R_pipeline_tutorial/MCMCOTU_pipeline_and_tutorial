#MCMCOTU Tutorial. 
#MCMCOTU is a package written by Mischa Matz to handle CLustered Illumina data exported from CD-HIT-OTU
#This package is written in R and must be used R or R Studio. 


##LOAD AND INSTALL packages you might need
#source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R") #To download DESeq package (you can comment these lines out, they only need to be run once ever)
#biocLite( "MCMCglmm")

library(MCMC.OTU)
library(ggplot2)
library(vegan)

#READ IN YOUR DATA FILE
#dat<-read.csv(file="cmb_OTU_100.nr2nd.clstr.sample_revised.csv", sep=",", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

###SUBSET DATA BY CORAL SPECIES### 

ssid=subset(dat, species=="ssid")
srad=subset(dat, species=="srad")
pstr=subset(dat, species=="pstr")
#write.csv(pstr, file="pstr.csv")

##Identifier codes for my sample data
#species= ssid, pstr, srad
#site= numbers 1-11
#type= low, mod, high
#lat= placencia, sapodilla, dangriga, belize_city

###RUNNING MCMCOTU#####

###SSID ONLY###
goods=purgeOutliers(ssid, count.columns=6:5089) #change input file to subset by species, you will want to edit this line to make sure you include how many columns you had!
#note: only include columns that contain counts (no categorical variables)
head(goods) #'goods' is the dataframe that contains all the non-outlier samples (outliers were removed by purgeOutliers)

# what is the proportion of samples with data for these OTUs?
apply(goods[,6:length(goods[1,])],2,function(x){sum(x>0)/length(x)})

# what percentage of global total counts each OTU represents?
apply(goods[,6:length(goods[1,])],2,function(x){sum(x)/sum(goods[,6:length(goods[1,])])})

# stacking the data; adjust otu.columns and condition.columns values for your data
gss=otuStack(goods,count.columns=c(6:length(goods[1,])),condition.columns=c(1:5))

head(gss)

##We have now removed outlier samples and stacked data in the proper format for MCMCOTU

###A MCMCOTU RUN###

mm=mcmc.otu(
	fixed="type", #type in this case is a categorical variable. Maybe you want 'site', 'latitude', 'reef', 'country', 'speies', or 'day' instead
	data=gss,
	nitt=56000,thin=50,burnin=50000 # a long MCMC chain to improve modeling of rare OTUs
	)
#plot(mm)	
	# selecting the OTUs that were modeled reliably
# (OTUs that are too rare for confident parameter estimates are discarded) 
acpass=otuByAutocorr(mm,gss)
acpass

# calculating differences and p-values between all pairs of factor combinations
smm0=OTUsummary(mm,gss,otus=acpass,summ.plot=FALSE) 

# adjusting p-values for multiple comparisons:
smmA=padjustOTU(smm0)
head(smmA)

# significant OTUs at FDR<0.05:
sigs=signifOTU(smmA)
sigs #OTUS that are significantly different between 'types' or whatever variable you put in the model

# plotting the significant ones
smm1=OTUsummary(mm,gss,otus=sigs)

head(gss)
gss$count=gss$count+1
smmA$otuWise[sigs]
# table of log10-fold changes and p-values, this tells you what was signficant in the model. 

##You can adjust these models however you like to meet your needs. This is a simple rundown of how MCMCOTU works.
